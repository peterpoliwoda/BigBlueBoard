#Big Blue Board
__The one and only IBM specific Notice Board.__

## Description: 
Have you even looked for a car or accommodation when you first came to Dublin? You moved houses and for some reason, you couldn't find a place to post an ad and look for a person who would just like you work in IBM and have a similar way of life? A bit of a nerd that you know you could trust, at least so much that he was ot a criminal?
Have you got a new car and would like to sell your old one, but don't want to go around to the outskirts of the city, somewhere you have never been to make the deal. Would you like to settle it at work, during lunch after selling your car you'd be back in the canteen in no-time, just in time for your favourite canteen sandwich?

Now here's your chance!

You can find all you need on the Big Blue Board, and you know it's going to be safe! You know it's going to be convenient for you! You know it will just take a couple of steps, and the most you would have to go is the distance from Building 6 to Building 1!

So what are you waiting for? Check out Big Blue Board today!
